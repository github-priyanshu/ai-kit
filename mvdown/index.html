The whole night I dreamt like the one who was left only brave in this giant world. Some dreams I remembered with full enmotion that I will never loose and I could sacrifice my everything even my for her. The ultimate mother of mine: The Bharat Mata.

I woke up that day with a kind of energy which wuold go out of calculation of phisics. I came in the front of the miror with my proud looking face and full pressed fitting uniform of an Army man.

On duty I said to Colonel Tyagi Khan, "Jai Hind Sir". He said "At Ease". He knew me form before as we were friends in school when I was in class 4 and he was in class 10. We had a very long conversation with him. I remembered something I talked. I said, "I have no any fear of death rather I could go anywhere alone. He said, "okey". If the death is database which has the list of all the lifes then I am a hacker who deleted my record.

As the day passed the news were getting bad on India-Chine border. Now my these boasting dialogues were not coming out from the heart but encourage to them who listened it from me.

We reached their, we were having rest. I heard a sound of graned which a my big fire. We were ready with or all our rifles, granedes, bullets, jacketeg helmet shoes and many more things. Atmosphere was filled with bullets and its sound. The air between we and our enemy was trying to say something but we wery busy. I came behind the sack started firing, I would have helped the death by reducing his 5th of works. I had not thought that my words my my of boasting had encouraged friends so much that one of them went away from the sack and killed many. I was thinking that now his bullets wey were running out but he was unawere of it. The world stopped for me I feeled the fear of death. he fell in my sacking arms which transfered almost all his courage in my arms. I woke up with two rifles and killed 100s of them. Now they were not like jungle rather left like a crushed field. I was relaxed. I saw a deadly bullet coming toward me. I couldn't process, and I tried sitting down with a very great speed of a missile. And everthing which I had told to sacrifice got black..!!!

Suddenly, I had the power to listen, I could feel, I thougth that I am ghost now. I heard "From three years he didn't woke up, now no chance". "No doctor!", someone said. I rememberd that this was the voice of my wife. I processed these information and knew that I was comma. After few hours I had open my eyes but couldn't but could now speak to call anyone.

I understood that I was a successful HACKER.

Madan a very Intelligent boy of his school he didn't like the education system so for. And wanted to change it from its base to tip. He knew it very well that if he had to change it then he must go to sky from this wrong way only. He also knew it once it some one you to stay then their is no place to sit there. So, if he and stops, then it will be of no use. He accelareted his speed of sucess at a very entreame that after college only in 1 year. He was ranked 1st in UPSE. But this was not the glory of success. It was just 1% of his way to his goal. Now it was not appearing so blur rather clear like glass crystal to become a prime minister of India Madan. But as he had not tested the depression of loosing single times. Therefore everyday he went educated people who could eat the part of cake which was being eaten by Madan. Many refused and he was constantly facing the faliure. It seemed that the fate hay become his enemy by giving all the flops of his life at

Madan was so dipressed that for a while he thought life of a currupt I.A.S officer is much more better that that of than Mother Teresa.

There was another boy studling in class 10 in Latehar in a well affiliated school. He was mini me of I.A.S. Madan. His aim was so a clear as a glass crystal. After the board exam result & came with percentage 99.9%. the newspapers of whole Jharkhand were full of his name and photo. Yet the fate was playing a game of winning on loosing and unfortunately the next day newspaper was having 50% more selling with healdine,"Raghu, one who scored 99.9%. He comitted suicide". He had a suicide note composed of almost 3 pages of eulogy of the present education system. All that student in country had made Raghu the Bhagat Singh. The Government current had to completely transform the education system, according to all the points given in suicide netes.

And this was the day when Madan a top ranked IAS officer with head of his the commitee got the work. Which was his final

After 10 years the suicide rate of students in India was decreased to 90% of before.
